nimmu
====

A Node repl with `ImmutableJS` provided from the get go.

The purpose is to have a quick way to get to the ImmutableJS commands to test
and try random thoughts and ideas. Or practice. I mean, really, it's totally up
to you what you do with it. I don't care.

Usage
-----

After starting the repl, you will get a typical node prompt. your REPL out. Use
`_` to get to Immutable.
